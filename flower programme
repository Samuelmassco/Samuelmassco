#this is a project i really wanted to do, it uses more or less everything i lurned in my first year at polito
#this is a flower store, client can buy flower for the price they want and sometimes they dont buy flower 
#the idea is to colect data such as name, price etc.. and then calculate an average, 
#What's funny is that when you repeat it, the program converges towards the mathematical expectation. 
#This is somewhat an illustration of the law of large numbers.
